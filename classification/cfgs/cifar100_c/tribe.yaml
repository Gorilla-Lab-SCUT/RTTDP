  ETA: 0.05      # 0.01 on CIFAR10, 0.05 on CIFAR100, 0.5 on ImageNet1K. This term is related with the number of categories. [Roughly follow max(0.0005 * K., 0.01)]
  GAMMA: 0.1     # 0.0 on CIFAR10, 0.1 on CIFAR100, 0.5 on ImageNet1K. More details please see the paper. [Little sensitive]
  H0: 0.2       # 0.05 on CIFAR10, 0.2 on CIFAR100, 0.4 on ImageNet1K. Entropy threshold is related with the accuracy of source domain. [Not sensitive]
  LAMBDA: 0.5    # This term is usually constant as 0.5
